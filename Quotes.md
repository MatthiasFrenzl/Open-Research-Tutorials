„you can explain evolutionary adaption using thermodynamics, even in intriguing cases where there are no self-replicators and Darwinian logic breaks down“. Jeremy England


#### Predicting the future
Thermodynamical cost storing information about the past that has no predictive value for the future(Susanne Still, Gavin Gooks).
To be maximally efficient, a system has to be selective (Quanta)
If it 

If it indiscriminately remembers everything that happened, it incurs a large energy cost. On the other hand, if it doesn’t bother storing any information about its environment at all, it will be constantly struggling to cope with the unexpected. “A thermodynamically optimal machine must balance memory against prediction by minimizing its nostalgia — the useless information about the past,’’ said a co-author, David Sivak, now at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia

In short, it must become good at harvesting meaningful information — that which is likely to be useful for future survival.

To acquire their remarkable efficiency, Still said, these devices must “implicitly construct concise representations of the world they have encountered so far, enabling them to anticipate what’s to come.”

#### Replication-Times of Cells
Empirical evidence seems to bear that out. It has been long known that cultured human cells seem able to replicate no more than 40 to 60 times (called the Hayflick limit) before they stop and become senescent.
